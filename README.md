## Session 1: PyTorch basics

In this session (notebook `class_1_session.ipynb`) we learn the basics of PyTorch by optimizing a 1-parameter model on a set of noisy points. Topics covered:

  - What are the loss function and loss landscape.
  - How the Gradient Descent method works.
  - What are the `torch.Tensor` and `torch.nn.Parameter` classes.
  - Basics of PyTorch Optimizers.
  - How are gradients computed, stored and utilized in PyTorch
  - Basics of PyTorch Learning Rate Schedulers.
  - Sensibility of model training wrt. learning rate.
  - The training loop in detail, with basic metric logging and visualization.

Afterwards, an exercice (`class_1_exercice.ipynb`) is proposed where the session steps must be reproduced to optimize a 3-parameter model.
